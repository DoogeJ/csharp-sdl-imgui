# C# SDL + OpenGL + ImGui Renderer

[SDL2-CS](https://github.com/flibitijibibo/SDL2-CS)
[ImGui.Net](https://github.com/mellinoe/ImGui.NET)


### Getting Started

```csharp

```

## License
Whatever

### Acknowledgements
This code actually began as a fork/addition of the [opengl4sharp](https://github.com/giawa/opengl4csharp/tree/dotnetcore) lib. Unfortunately, that didn't work out so this ended up being a near total rewrite besides keeping the OpenGL enums.
